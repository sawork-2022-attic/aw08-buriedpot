Run the project with `mvn spring-boot:run` and send request to `http://localhost:8080/check`. You should see an reponses in json format like the following.

```json
{
    "icon_url": "https://assets.chucknorris.host/img/avatar/chuck-norris.png",
    "id": "kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "url": "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/kswv7NIaTCaIIErlBzODaA",
    "value": "Chuck Norris's shadow weighs 250 pounds and can kick your ass ."
}
```

Try to understand the provided code which demonstrates spring integration between a spring boot application with an externel http service (https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random).

Please implement delivery as an standalone service (just like the random joke service). Refer the sample code to integrate your Micropos system with delivery service so that user can check delivery status on Miropos which actually forwards user request to delivery service on demand.

Consider the advantage by doing so and write it down in your readme file.





优势：

* Integration消息驱动通信，响应及时。
* Integration代码量极小，易读。
* 其是各种关键技术的集大成者，集成了mongoDB、RabbitMq、Feed、File、FTP、Gemfire、HTTP、JDBC等，会为未来spring的易用性提升有非常大的帮助。将这么多东西的传输和处理进行了集成。
